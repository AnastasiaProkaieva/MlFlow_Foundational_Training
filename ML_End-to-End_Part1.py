# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Import data
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC In this section, you download a dataset from the web and upload it to Databricks File System (DBFS).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/ and download both `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv` to your local machine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. From this Databricks notebook, select *File* > *Upload Data*, and drag these files to the drag-and-drop target to upload them to the Databricks File System (DBFS). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC     **Note**: if you don't have the *File* > *Upload Data* option, you can load the dataset from the Databricks example datasets. Uncomment and run the last two lines in the following cell.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Click *Next*. Some auto-generated code to load the data appears. Select *pandas*, and copy the example code. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Create a new cell, then paste in the sample code. It will look similar to the code shown in the following cell. Make these changes:
# MAGIC   - Pass `sep=';'` to `pd.read_csv`
# MAGIC   - Change the variable names from `df1` and `df2` to `white_wine` and `red_wine`, as shown in the following cell.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

# If you have the File > Upload Data menu option, follow the instructions in the previous cell to upload the data from your local machine.
# The generated code, including the required edits described in the previous cell, is shown here for reference.

# In the following lines, replace <username> with your username.
#white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/<username>/winequality_white.csv", sep=';')
#red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/<username>/winequality_red.csv", sep=';')

# If you do not have the File > Upload Data menu option, uncomment and run these lines to load the dataset.
white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)
# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)
# Let's check the header of the input data 
data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

data.shape

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Visualize data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.distplot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful in noticing correlations between features and a binary label.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dims = (3, 4)

f, axes = plt.subplots(dims[0], dims[1], figsize=(25, 15))
axis_i, axis_j = 0, 0
for col in data.columns:
  if col == 'is_red' or col == 'quality':
    continue # Box plots cannot be used on indicator variables
  sns.boxplot(x=high_quality, y=data[col], ax=axes[axis_i, axis_j])
  axis_j += 1
  if axis_j == dims[1]:
    axis_i += 1
    axis_j = 0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocess data
# MAGIC Prior to training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

data.isna().any()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are no missing values.

# COMMAND ----------

train, test = train_test_split(data, random_state=123)
X_train = train.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
X_test = test.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y_train = train.quality
y_test = test.quality

# COMMAND ----------

# Save test and train into delta 
# write into Spark DF 
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(data)
spark_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").option('overwriteSchema', 'true').saveAsTable("wine_data")

# COMMAND ----------

display(spark_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Build a baseline model
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code builds a simple classifier using scikit-learn. It uses MLflow to keep track of the model accuracy, and to save the model for later use.

# COMMAND ----------

# The predict method of sklearn's RandomForestClassifier returns a binary classification (0 or 1). 
# The following code creates a wrapper function, SklearnModelWrapper, that uses 
# the predict_proba method to return the probability that the observation belongs to each class. 

class SklearnModelWrapper(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):
  def __init__(self, model):
    self.model = model
    
  def predict(self, context, model_input):
    return self.model.predict_proba(model_input)[:,1]
  
# mlflow.start_run creates a new MLflow run to track the performance of this model. 
# Within the context, you call mlflow.log_param to keep track of the parameters used, and
# mlflow.log_metric to record metrics like accuracy.
with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f'untuned_random_forest_{user_name}'):
  n_estimators = 10 
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, random_state=np.random.RandomState(123))
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # predict_proba returns [prob_negative, prob_positive], so slice the output with [:, 1]
  predictions_test = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
  auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_test, predictions_test)
  mlflow.log_param('n_estimators', n_estimators)
  # Use the area under the ROC curve as a metric.
  mlflow.log_metric('auc', auc_score)
  # Wrap the model 
  wrappedModel = SklearnModelWrapper(model)
  # Log the model with a signature that defines the schema of the model's inputs and outputs. 
  # When the model is deployed, this signature will be used to validate inputs.
  signature = infer_signature(X_train, wrappedModel.predict(None, X_train))
  
  # MLflow contains utilities to create a conda environment used to serve models.
  # The necessary dependencies are added to a conda.yaml file which is logged along with the model.
  conda_env =  _mlflow_conda_env(
        additional_conda_deps=None,

        additional_conda_channels=None,
    )
  # log your model into MlFlow 
  mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(f"random_forest_model_{user_name}", python_model=wrappedModel, conda_env=conda_env, signature=signature)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Examine the learned feature importances output by the model as a sanity-check.

# COMMAND ----------

feature_importances = pd.DataFrame(model.feature_importances_, index=X_train.columns.tolist(), columns=['importance'])
feature_importances.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md As illustrated by the boxplots shown previously, both alcohol and density are important in predicting quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You logged the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to MLflow. Click **Experiment** at the upper right to display the Experiment Runs sidebar. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The model achieved an AUC of 0.89. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A random classifier would have an AUC of 0.5, and higher AUC values are better. For more information, see [Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md #### Register the model in MLflow Model Registry
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC By registering this model in Model Registry, you can easily reference the model from anywhere within Databricks.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following section shows how to do this programmatically, but you can also register a model using the UI. See "Create or register a model using the UI" ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#create-or-register-a-model-using-the-ui)|[Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/applications/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index#create-or-register-a-model-using-the-ui)|[GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#create-or-register-a-model-using-the-ui)).

# COMMAND ----------

run_id = mlflow.search_runs(filter_string=f'tags.mlflow.runName = "untuned_random_forest_{user_name}"').iloc[0].run_id

# COMMAND ----------

# If you see the error "PERMISSION_DENIED: User does not have any permission level assigned to the registered model", 
# the cause may be that a model already exists with the name "wine_quality". Try using a different name.
model_name = f"wine_quality_{user_name}_{uuid_num}"
model_version = mlflow.register_model(f"runs:/{run_id}/random_forest_model_{user_name}", model_name)

# Registering the model takes a few seconds, so add a small delay
time.sleep(15)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You should now see the model in the Models page. To display the Models page, click the Models icon in the left sidebar. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Next, transition this model to production and load it into this notebook from Model Registry.

# COMMAND ----------

print('Your registered model name is : {}'.format(model_name))

# COMMAND ----------

client = MlflowClient()
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name=model_name,
  version=model_version.version,
  stage="Production",
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md The Models page now shows the model version in stage "Production".
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can now refer to the model using the path "models:/wine_quality/production".

# COMMAND ----------

model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_name}/production")

# Sanity-check: This should match the AUC logged by MLflow
print(f'AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))}')
